# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created as pre-work before starting coding bootcamp. I was excited to learn how to use Github and the basic elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Computers are present in every aspect of my life and this project took me one step closer to understanding how developers create websites, games, and so much more.

I experimented and de-bugged several errors as they came up, learning more about the coding process with each failure. This project is an opportunity for me to continuosly build on the skills I learn and track them in a centralized webpage. I was previously concerned about tracking my progress but this webpage is a visualization of the skills I am learning.

So far I learned HTML basics on webpage structure, how to add style with CSS, and creating interactivity with JS. Github is a valuable resource for all developers and I am really excited about utilizing it's power to collaborate on projects moving forward.
